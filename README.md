# Lasso/Ridge Regression

This is a project completed by the DEV10 Associates listed below in Week 9 of the 13-week bootcamp. It characterizes and investigates the Lasso and Ridge Regression algorithms on several datasets. The datasets used in this project include the `cars93` dataset from the Cooper Union, the `diabetes` dataset from scikit-learn, and a `diamonds` dataset from Kaggle.

## Contributions

- Jessica Hoffman: Investigated the effect of regularization strength on the Lasso and Ridge regression coefficients on the `cars93` dataset and the [Cooper Union Car Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset) to see if model drift impacted later model vehicle price prediction. 
- Jake Uhl: Compared the performance of the Lasso and Ridge regression algorithms on the `diabetes` dataset.
- Jesse Noss: ACompared the performance of the Lasso and Ridge regression algorithms on the `diabetes` dataset.e `diamonds` dataset.
